# I am Sameul Morse 2! - Cryptography Challenge

## Basic Information
**Name:** I am Sameul Morse 2!  
**Category:** Cryptography  
**Points:** 200

## Objective

The "I am Sameul Morse 2!" challenge is a cryptography task. Your objective is to decode a message written in Morse code and retrieve the hidden flag.

## Solution

To successfully complete the "I am Sameul Morse 2!" cryptography challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the Challenge:**
   - This challenge is not significantly different from the previous "I am Samuel Morse." You'll be dealing with Morse code.

2. **Use an Online Morse Code Decoder:**
   - To decode the Morse code message and reveal the flag, it is recommended to use an online Morse code decoder tool. A suitable decoder can be found at [Morse Code World - Audio Decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html).

3. **Decode the Morse Code:**
   - Input the Morse code message provided in the challenge into the online decoder. The tool will convert the Morse code into text.

4. **Wrap the Message in the Flag Format:**
   - After decoding the message, you should obtain the flag in plain text. Wrap the flag message with the standard CTF flag format, which is typically "skr{flag_text}".

Flag: skr{XXXXXXXXXX}

**Challenge Solved**
