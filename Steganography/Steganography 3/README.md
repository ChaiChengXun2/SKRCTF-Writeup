# Steganography 3 - Steganography Challenge

## Basic Information
**Name:** Steganography 3  
**Category:** Steganography  
**Points:** 200

## Objective

The "Steganography 3" challenge is a steganography task that involves reconstructing a fragmented QR code and then decoding it to retrieve the flag. Your objective is to piece together the fragmented QR code pieces and use a QR code reader to extract the hidden flag.

## Solution

To successfully complete the "Steganography 3" steganography challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Fragmented QR Code Pieces:**
   - You are given fragmented pieces of a QR code. Your task is to reconstruct the complete QR code from these pieces.

2. **Use an Image Editor:**
   - To piece the QR code fragments together, you can use image editing software. In this case, I used Canva, which is a graphic design tool that can be used for image manipulation.

3. **Reconstruct the QR Code:**
   - Piece together the fragmented QR code segments to create a complete QR code image. They are also numbered for your convenience.

4. **Transfer the Image:**
   - Once you have the complete QR code image, scan it to find the flag. 

5. **Use QR Code Reader:**
   - But I chose to download it to my  Kali Linux instead. I used a QR code reader tool known as `zbarimg` to read  the QR code. 

6. **Flag Extraction:**
   - After reading the QR code with `zbarimg`, you will obtain the flag. The flag is hidden within the QR code, and this process reveals it.
