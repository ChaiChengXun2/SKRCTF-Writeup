# SKRCTF-Writeup
Welcome to my repository of SKRCTF writeups! Here, you'll find comprehensive solutions to a wide range of challenges across various domains, including Warm Up, Web, Cryptography, Forensics, Reverse Engineering, Binary, Linux, Steganography, Mini Game, OSINT, Programming, and Miscellaneous.

Through the challenges, I try my best to use KALI Linux tools to solve problems instead of relying on online tools to complete them.

## Motivation

The main purpose of this repository is to document my journey through SKRCTF challenges. By sharing my solutions and strategies, I aim to contribute to the learning and growth of the CTF community and my own CTF abilities. Moreover, I prioritize using Kali Linux tools to solve problems, rather than relying solely on online resources.

## Challenges

Detailed writeups for each challenge can be found in their respective directories. The challenges are organized according to their specific domains, making it easy for you to navigate and explore.
