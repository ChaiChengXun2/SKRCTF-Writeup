# Ular Challenge 1 - Reverse Engineering Challenge

## Basic Information
**Name:** Ular Challenge 1  
**Category:** Reverse Engineering  
**Points:** 20

## Objective

The "Ular Challenge 1" is a reverse engineering challenge that involves deobfuscating a heavily obfuscated code to discover a series of password checks. Your objective is to decode each of the password checks to find the correct password, which will lead to the flag.

## Solution

To successfully complete the "Ular Challenge 1" reverse engineering challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Examine the Downloaded File:**
   - After downloading the challenge, you will find a file containing heavily obfuscated code. This code is the starting point of the challenge.

2. **Deobfuscate the Code:**
   - Begin by deobfuscating the code. Deobfuscation involves removing the obfuscation techniques applied to make the code difficult to read.

3. **Analyze the Code:**
   - Once the code is deobfuscated, you will discover a series of password checks embedded within the code. These checks are essential to finding the correct password.

4. **Decode the Password Checks:**
   - Analyze each of the password checks to decode them. This might involve understanding the logic of the checks and revealing the actual passwords being compared.

5. **Find the Correct Password:**
   - Continue decoding each of the password checks until you identify the correct password. The correct password is the one that successfully passes all the checks.
