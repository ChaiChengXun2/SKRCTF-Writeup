## Solving
The "What is ROT?" challenge introduces you to the ROT encryption algorithm, a symmetric encryption technique known as a shift cipher. ROT works by shifting each letter in the alphabet a certain number of positions.

### Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to solve the challenge:

1. **Utilize Online Tools:**
   - Visit an online tool like CyberChef, which provides various encryption and decryption functions.
   - CyberChef Link: [CyberChef ROT13](https://cyberchef.org/#recipe=ROT13(true,true,false,13)&input=RlhFe0UwZ19LVlZWfQ)

2. **Input Cipher Text:**
   - In the online tool, paste the provided cipher text into the algorithm:
     ```
     FXE{E0g_KVVV}
     ```

3. **Decrypt the Text:**
   - Execute the ROT decryption function by clicking the appropriate button in the online tool.

4. **Retrieve the Flag:**
   - The decrypted text will reveal the flag.
     ```
     SKR{XXXXXXXXXXXX}
     ```

**Challenge Completed!**

By using an online ROT decryption tool to decipher the provided text, you successfully revealed the flag: "SKR{R0t_XIII}". This demonstrates your understanding of the ROT encryption algorithm.
