## Solving
The concept of this challenge is learn to read files within a webpage. If it is unknown to you, all the code necessary to make a webpage work is available publically for anyone to see. Opening source page will allow anyone to view the HTML, CSS and JavaScript necessary to make the webpage. 
  
**Step 1:**  
View the JS (JavaScript) necessary to make the webpage work. We can see that it does not carry out any server-side validation for the login process. Everything is handled client-side, therefore we are able to find the username and passwords for the login. 
```Username: godam ```  
```Password: Sup3rSecr3t4ndS3cur3P@s$W0rD```

**Step 2:**   
Login with the credentials and complete the challenge  
```SKR{N3ver_Us3_J@v4Scr1pT_F0r_Au7h3nt1c4ti0n_3ca688}```
