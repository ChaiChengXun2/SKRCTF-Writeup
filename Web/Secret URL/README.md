The concept of this challenge is to familiarise yourself with robots.txt. A robots.txt file is a set of instructions for bots that visit a website. It is used to maintain privacy from the internet and control which parts of the website are accesible to bots. 
  
**Step 1:**  
In the URL given to you, append ```/robots.txt``` to it.  
Example: ```URL/robots.txt```   

**Step 2:**   
You will be greeted with a disallow link. Hmm, suspicious. Disallow?? Try appending the disallow URI onto the URL previously. 
Example: ```URL/916767aa91f2f5d6cb2ab7b13a4eae55.html```
